# Amazon-Clone
This is the web application developed in react which uses mongodb for database. Note: You must install mongodb first before running this application. This is developed as similar as it can with amzon site.. And more importantly I am not super professional so you may face some features missing.. I haven't full cloned amazon but it is very similar to amzon site... Let me know what you think about it.. If you face any bug please report me I will love to see your reviews

* I have split my website in two faces: Admin Site(Used to do CRED operations in database) and the actual site which the user will see...

# Normal User Site
